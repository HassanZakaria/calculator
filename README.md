# Basic Calculator using React Hooks

For my first ever project, I chose to create this basic calculator to put my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React to the test.<br>
This project deeply reinforced how I should be thinking in React components. It also bolstered my understanding of useState hook, how to pass props between several components, and the JavaScript map function. <br>
I used React Bootstrap for the calculator buttons, and CSS grid for the layout. <br>
